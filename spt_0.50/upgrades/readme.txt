### UPGRADE SPT TO VERSION 0.5 ###

NOTE:  You can only upgrade from version 0.42.  If you are not at version 0.42, please
 either upgrade first to version 0.42 or perform a clean installation instead of version
 0.5 of the spt.
 

To update your currently installed version of spt, follow these steps.

*** Please back up your spt database before performing the upgrade ***

1.  Log out of all active spt sessions.

2.  Extract the files contained in the *_upgrade folder to local disk.

3.  Copy all upgrade files to the location where spt is installed.  

NOTE:  Select the files contained within the spt folder, do not select the spt folder itself.

4.  Access your spt installation at http://install_location/install.php to start the upgrade.

5.  When prompted with the message "Installation files still exist! What do you want to do?", click to start the "Install".

6.  Complete the installation steps to perform the upgrade.

7.  Log into your newly upgraded spt installation.


Happy education!
